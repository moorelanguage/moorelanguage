## Hi there 👋
I am a Lenape language enthusiast and computational linguistics hobbyist-combining linguistics and technology.   
I love exploring languages and building tools to support language learning, preservation, and tools in those languages. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Lenape Dictionary program
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lenape
- ⏸️ I'm currently researching Low-Resource ASR in my free-time, but it is on the backburner right now. 
- 📄 I'm employeed on a short-term project.
